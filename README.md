# :floppy_disk: SNES Emulator for Raspberry Pi Pico

Using parts from Hack Club's sprig console. This should be possible?

## Dev Notes

- pico has 2 MB of flash memory for stuff to get loaded
- Super Mario World rom is ~512 KB for reference
- use roms folder to store roms, so it won't get committed
  - piracy is bad :skull:
