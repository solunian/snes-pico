# :floppy_disk: SNES Emulator for Raspberry Pi Pico

## Dev Notes

- probably using C/C++ to emulate?
    - some youtube videos and stuff 
    - pretty sure there are some test roms
    - I don't think I'll have to learn assembly for the cpu
- pico has 2 MB of flash memory for stuff to get loaded
- Super Mario World rom is ~512 KB for reference
- use roms folder to store roms, so it won't get committed
  - piracy is bad :skull:
